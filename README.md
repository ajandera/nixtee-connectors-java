### **Nixtee Connectors for Java**

Nixtee Connectors for Java is a set of libraries that enable seamless interaction with Nixtee's services and APIs. It allows developers to integrate various Nixtee services into their Java applications.

---

#### **Getting Started**

To use the Nixtee Connectors in your project, you will need to include them as a dependency in your **Maven** or **Gradle** project.

##### **Maven**
Add the following to your `pom.xml`:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.nixtee</groupId>
  <artifactId>nixtee-connectors-java</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

##### **Gradle**
Add this to your `build.gradle`:
```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.nixtee:nixtee-connectors-java:1.0.0'
}
```

##### **JitPack**
[JitPack](https://jitpack.io/) is a service that builds and hosts Java projects from GitHub, making it easy to share a Java library without publishing to Maven Central.

   **Add JitPack as a Repository**:
   - Add JitPack as a repository in their `pom.xml`:

   ```xml
   <repositories>
       <repository>
           <id>jitpack.io</id>
           <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
       </repository>
   </repositories>

   <dependency>
       <groupId>com.github.ajandera</groupId>
       <artifactId>nixtee-connector-java</artifactId>
       <version>Tag</version>
   </dependency>
   ```

---

#### **Setup**

After adding the library to your project, you can initialize the connectors by providing appropriate configurations and API keys for authentication with Nixtee services.

#### **Usage Example**

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use one of the connectors:

```java
import com.nixtee.connector.NixteeConnector;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NixteeConnector connector = new NixteeConnector("your-api-key");
        String result = connector.connect();
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```

In this example, replace `"your-api-key"` with your actual Nixtee API key.
